Prerequisites
=============

In order to use any of my images, you'll need Vagrant.

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) from HashiCorp

Before you can build the Packer images provided by this repository,
you must install the following applications on your local computer (host).

- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html) from HashiCorp
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) from Oracle

# Prerequisite Versions

Ensuring broad Vagrant, Packer, and VirtualBox compatibility is not
within the scope of this project, but many versions of those
applications _should_ work.  Just in case, though, here are the versions
that this repo was developed against:

* Vagrant v1.8.5
* Packer v1.0.3
* VirtualBox v5.1.2 r108956
