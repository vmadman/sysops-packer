Luke's Packer Templates: About
==============================

This repository contains my personal Packer templates, which are used
to build various images (e.g. Vagrant Images) across my projects.

I started this repository by cherry picking files from the [Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento)
repository, which is Chef's official base-box library, and then customized
it for my purposes from there.  If you find my configurations to be
too limited or opinionated, and you'd like to use Chef in your base
boxes, then I highly suggest checking out the Bento project; it is a
very nice resource.
